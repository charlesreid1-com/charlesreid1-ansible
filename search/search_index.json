Link: Ansible vault documentation Table of Contents \u00b6 What is Ansible Vault? Where is the vault file? How to view the vault file? How to create a vault file? How to edit the vault file? How to use the vault file? Adding new secret variables What is Ansible Vault? \u00b6 Ansible provides a \"vault\" function that allows sensitive data (passwords, sensitive info, or certificate files) to be encrypted, so it can be stored in a repository with the rest of the playbook. The vault is an ordinary YAML file that defines variables, except that the variables it defines are sensitive. These variables can be used elsewhere in the playbook. Ansible provides an ansible-vault command to interact with vault files. Where is the vault file? \u00b6 There is currently one vault file that applies to all servers. It is located in the repository at group_vars/all/vault . How to view the vault file? \u00b6 To view the contents of the vault file, use the view action: ansible-vault edit my_vault_file How to create a vault file? \u00b6 No new vault files should be needed for this repository, but to create a new vault file called my_vault_file , use the create action: ansible-vault create my_vault_file How to edit the vault file? \u00b6 To edit the contents of the vualt file, use the edit action EDITOR=\"vim\" ansible-vault edit my_vault_file How to use the vault file? \u00b6 Vault files are used by ansible in the process of running playbooks. The user can provide Ansible with the vault password either on the command line (via an interactive prompt), or the user can put the vault password into a file, and point Ansible to the vault password file when it is run. We do that latter, putting the vault password in the file .vault_secret . To tell ansible wehre to find the vault password, we set vault_password_file in the configuration file. In both configuration files, we have: vault_password_file = .vault_secret Put your password into the file .vault_secret and use this configuration file (by pointing to it with the ANSIBLE_CONFIG environment variable when running ansible). Adding new secret variables \u00b6 Suppose we have a role that utilizes a variable that is sensitive and should remain secret. To do this, we set up a series of variable definitions that allow the secret defined in the vault to be used for different roles. Suppose we have a role that uses an API key in a command. The role utilizes a variable {{ api_key }} like so: roles/my-role/tasks/main.yml : --- - name: A simple example task using a secret variable command: \"python script.py --api-key={{ api_key }}\" If the variable api_key is defined in the task default variable values, this command will be run but with an invalid API key. If the above command should only be run with a valid API key, you can leave api_key out of the default variable values. Here is what that would look like, if you defined the API key to be an empty string by default: roles/my-role/defaults/main.yml : --- api_key: \"\" To set the real api_key value, override the default variable value in the playbook(s) that run that role. For example, if the role my-role is called from a playbook main.yml , main.yml : --- - name: Run my-role roles: - role: my-role api_key: \"{{ charlesreid1_api_key }}\" This specifies that the api_key variable should be set to the value of the variable charlesreid1_api_key . The prefix charlesreid1 indicates a site-specific variable setting. Those variables are contained in group_vars/all/main.yml . The variable is defined there, but it is also defining the variable to be set to another variable value: group_vars/all/main.yml : --- charlesreid1_api_key: \"{{ vault_api_key }}\" The last step is to define the variable in the vault. This is where we use the ansible-vault command to edit the vault file: ANSIBLE_CONFIG=\"my_config.cfg\" ansible-vault edit group_vars/all/vault This is where you put the real API key: group_vars/all/vault : --- vault_api_key: \"ABCXYZ123456\"","title":"Ansible Vault"},{"location":"ansible_vault/#ansible-vault","text":"This page contains instructions for using the Ansible vault.

Use the provided one or modify it for your needs. Start a vagrant virtual machine with: vagrant up Run the initial setup play with Ansible using the provision.yml provision playbook: ANSIBLE_CONFIG=\"vagrant.cfg\" vagrant provision Get info about how to connect to the vagrant machine(s) via SSH: vagrant ssh-config This information should match what is in the vagranthosts inventory file. Run Ansible \u00b6 Set Up Vault Secret \u00b6 Before running Ansible with the Ansible-Vagrant config file, it will expect the vault secret to be in a file called .vault_secret in the current directory. Create this file before proceeding. Example .vault_secret file: this_is_my_super_strong_password! Run the Playbook \u00b6 To run a playbook, use the ANSIBLE_CONFIG environment variable to specify the Ansible-Vagrant config file, and use the ansible-playbook command: ANSIBLE_CONFIG=\"vagrant.cfg\" ansible-playbook base.yml The config file specifies the inventory file, SSH key, vault password, and log file to use, among other details. Change Variables \u00b6 You can modify variables in the group_vars/main.yml file. $ cat group_vars/main.yml ... my_var_1: \"red\" my_var_2: \"blue\" Alternatively, you can pass custom variable values on the command line. This is how we specify the machine name when running charlesreid1.com playbooks. $ ANSIBLE_CONFIG=\"my_config_file.cfg\" \\ ansible-playbook \\ -i hosts \\ --extra-vars \"my_var_1=red,my_var_2=blue\" \\ playbook.yml","title":"Quickstart"},{"location":"quickstart/#quickstart","text":"This quickstart walks through the process of using Vagrant and running the charlesreid1 playbooks against a Vagrant machine.","title":"Quickstart"},{"location":"quickstart/#table-of-contents","text":"Vagrant Setup Start Vagrant Machines Run Ansible Set Up Vault Secret Run the Playbook Change Variables","title":"Table of Contents"},{"location":"quickstart/#vagrant-setup","text":"Vagrant is a command-line wrapper around VirtualBox and allows setting up one or more virtual machines to test out Ansible playbooks locally. we have a vagrant file for the role, but if you don't you can do vagrant init ubuntu/xenial64","title":"Vagrant Setup"},{"location":"quickstart/#start-vagrant-machines","text":"The following commands require a Vagrantfile .
