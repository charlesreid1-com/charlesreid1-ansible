# tasks file for letsencrypt
#
# Problem:
# We want to install certificates no matter what,
# but we don't want to ask for genuine certificates
# every time we run this playbook.
#
# Solution:
# Check if there is a LetsEncrypt renewal file
# (which indicates the user has manually requested
# genuine certificates from LetsEncrypt).
# If it is not there, install self-signed, snake oil
# certificates.



# Install required packages:

- name: Install software-properties-common
  become: yes
  apt: name=software-properties-common update_cache=yes

- name: Install ssl-cert package
  become: yes
  apt: name=ssl-cert update_cache=yes

- name: Add LetsEncrypt certbot apt repo
  become: yes
  apt_repository:
    repo: ppa:certbot/certbot

- name: Update aptitude after adding apt repo
  become: yes
  apt:
    update_cache: yes

- name: Install certbot
  become: yes

# The following stat checks for the existence of a
# LetsEncrypt renewal file, which indicates that
# LetsEncrypt has been run and set up.
# 
# If the node is in production mode, if LetsEncrypt 
# has been run, `cert_installed` will be true.
#
# If the node is still in staging mode, and LetsEncrypt
# has not yet been run, `cert_installed` will be false.
#
# This boolean is used to control how we deal with
# the nginx configuration file. (Test config is removed
# once node is live.)
