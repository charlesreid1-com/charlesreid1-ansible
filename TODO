mediawiki skin:
- we made it templatable already
- actually template it
- charlesreid1-config git repo

charlesreid1 theme:
- make links templatable

letsencrypt:
- set up script to renew the stupid letsencrypt every month

more letsencrypt:
- the pod-charlesreid1 role defaults has a top_domain set to charlesreid1.com
- it says, "check for letsencrypt certs to this domain (top level domain of entire pod)"
- this does not match up with the nginx config files... which is how things are REALLY set
- top domain is used by gitea...
